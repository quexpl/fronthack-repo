**Huge change** - Bootsmacss is now standalone framework! We resigned from depending on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)! As a results file strucute become more clean, and SASS structure is more consistent. You can still use the [Bootstrap version](https://github.com/frontcraft/bootsmacss/tree/bootstrap), but it is not supported anymore.
