=========

As a short for Bootstrap SMACSS, BootSMACSS is a starterkit library for frontend web developers, that can be treat as a SMACSS implementation of Bootstrap. Based on experience with Web Components approach on goverment sites development, it's everything you need to create modular frontend for responsive websites.

**Why? Because we needed something more flexible and scalable for rapid development than Bootstrap**

## Technologies included
BootSMACSS is nothing else than fusion of becoming increasingly popular technologies and approaches that we like very much:

* **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)** - because you need a good base and Swiss Army Knife, all Bootstrap goods are in your hands
* **[SMACSS](https://smacss.com/)** - because you need CSS that is scalable and easy to maintain
* **SCSS** - as above
* **[KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss/)** - as you can render [styleguide](http://htanjo.github.io/kss-node-template/) based on your components
* **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)** - to render static html prototypes as a result of graphic project's implementation that can be shown to client, tested and implemented later to CMS, or deployed to production server
