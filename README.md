As a short for Bootstrap SMACSS, BootSMACSS is a set of tools you should use for web frontend development. First of all it's a web components library that extends the capabilities of Bootstrap. Except that, BootSMACSS includes technologies, that will improve your workflow and documentation to learn how to use them.

**Why? Because we needed something more flexible and scalable for rapid development than Bootstrap**

## Technologies included
BootSMACSS is nothing else than fusion of becoming increasingly popular approaches that we liked very much:

* **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)** - because you need a good base and Swiss Army Knife, all Bootstrap goods are in your hands
* **[SMACSS](https://smacss.com/)** - because you need CSS that is scalable and easy to maintain
* **SCSS** - as above
* **[KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss/)** - as you can render [styleguide](http://htanjo.github.io/kss-node-template/) based on your components
* **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)** - to render static html prototypes as a result of graphic project's implementation that can be shown to client, tested and implemented later to CMS, or deployed to production server
